# BRWSR.INFO

BRWSR.INFO is a simple tool that uses [Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/) and [SWFObject](https://code.google.com/p/swfobject/) to output some useful information about a browser's capabilities. This enables non-technical people to easy see, copy or email technical information that can aid a developer in troubleshooting cross-browser web development. It is also easy to pull up the page on a mobile device and email the results.

## ABOUT

This is a simple tool, built quickly to solve a specific use case I encountered. It's not meant to solve all problems for everyone, but I am happy to share it as a reference or starting point for similar applications.
